Once the user has login, the access to the data is granted and we can choose between 3 options, which are represented by 3 buttons.
!The first one is called "Save" and is used to download the data in order to be able to read them again even offline with the 3rd button.
!The second one is named "Refresh" and is used to refresh the page. The goal is to redownload the json file. In the Offline case the refresh button will display no data at all.
!The last one is named "load" and is used to read data from the internal storage of the smartphone. This button always work except if the users didn't even save once.
